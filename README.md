# Effects of Behaviour Adaptation on the Spread of Infectious Disease on Networks with Community Structures

The study investigates the influence of awareness in the spread of infectious disease on networks with community structures. Awareness is defined as the reaction of individuals to the presence of infections in their environment. As the number of infections rises, they adjust their behaviour such that the probability of becoming infected decreases. We distinguish between local, community and global awareness, that is, awareness of the number of infected among one's direct neighbours (local awareness), one's community (community awareness) and the entire network (global awareness). The impact of awareness is studied on an SIS epidemic model using stochastic simulations and the mean-field approach. The results are reported for two major characteristics of an epidemic: the epidemic prevalence and the epidemic threshold. As expected, each of these three types of awareness reduces the epidemic prevalence. Interestingly, the epidemic threshold is lowered only by the local awareness and possibly by the community awareness when the communities are small.
